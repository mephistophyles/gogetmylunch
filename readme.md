### Go Get My Lunch

Based on the (famous?) game of the Around the NFL podcast crew. Props are made, people can take you up on it. The stakes are (fictitious) high-octane sandwiches. 

For now it's a simple use-case for building a Django Rest Framework running a React frontend. 

### Development Plan

 * For now I want to use this example to get a better handle on React. 
 * Later I will decouple the frontend from the backend completely and use JWT for authentication. 
 * Then using different frontend techs (and maybe different backends with the same database) be able to mix and match them, as long as the API is consistent between them this should work.
